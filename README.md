NOTE:
- Hosting WCF on console application.
- Two Clients using WCF services.
- WCF services has 2 endpoints. 
- One client using XML Message format over HTTP Protocol - Client Web Application
- Other client using Binary Message format over TCP Protocol - Client Window Application
- Run VisualStudio as Administrator. Since,  binding to a tcp port requires administrative privileges.
